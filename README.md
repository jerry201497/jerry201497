## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my professional portfolio! Currently studying a master's degree in Data Science. Here you'll find my personal projects and related information. Some of these projects are continuations of work I started during college, but others are passion projects based on personal interests. I hope you like them! :blush:
